    "Ans: 1. Qualitative Data\n",
    "Qualitative data, often known as category data, describes traits or attributes that are not quantifiable. It falls into two primary groups and contains descriptive information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nominal Scale: The nominal scale is used to represent categories that don't make sense. Every category is distinct yet equally significant.Example: Animal species (dog, cat, bird), eye color (blue, green, or brown), or gender (male or female).\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal_Scale: An ordinal scale is used to represent categories with a meaningful order but non-consistent or non-measurable intervals between values.\n",
    "Example: Education level (high school, bachelor's, master's), ranks (1st, 2nd, 3rd place), or satisfaction level (satisfied, indifferent, or unsatisfied).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Quantitative Data\n",
    "Quantitative data is numerical data that can be measured and quantified. It is divided into two sub-types:\n",
    "\n",
    "Interval_Scale : Zero does not imply \"none\" or \"nothing.\" Instead, the interval scale measures numerical values with equal intervals between values but no genuine zero point.\n",
    "Examples include IQ scores and temperature in either Celsius or Fahrenheit (0°C does not imply the lack of temperature).\n",
    "\n",
    "Ratio Scale: A true zero point and equal intervals are measured by the ratio scale, which enables the creation of meaningful ratios (e.g., twice as much).\n",
    "Example: Income (because 0 dollars indicates no income), height, weight, and age.\n"

    "Key Components of a Box Plot:\n",
    "1. Q2 median: The center value is displayed inside the box as a line.\n",

    "Skewness Types\n",
    "1. Right Skew, or Positive Skew:\n",
    "2. Definition: Longer or heavier is the right tail (greater values).\n",

    "Left Skew, or Negative Skew:\n",
    "1. Definition: Longer or heavier is the left tail (smaller values).\n",

    "The Impact of Skewness on Interpretation:\n",
